# About this Website

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a simple static site generator, and styled with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com). It is adapted from a template designed to help academic research groups create professional, clean, and customizable online presence.

### How It Works

The pages are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) and structured using [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templates. Dynamic content such as news, publications, and team members are stored in YAML files in the `_data` folder. You can easily update the content by editing these files.

### Getting Started

If you want to create a similar website:

1. Fork our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kha8128/mind-lab.github.io).
2. Clone it to your machine or edit directly on GitHub.
3. Modify the `_config.yml` file to set your site title, URL, and description.
4. Customize content by editing the markdown files in `_pages`, and YAML files in `_data`.

### Customization

- Update `_data/news.yml`, `_data/publist.yml`, and `_data/team.yml` with your labâ€™s information.
- Modify `_layouts` and `_includes` for layout and header/footer customizations.
- Customize styles via the `main.scss` file in the `css/` folder or override variables in `_sass/_variables.scss`.

### Hosting

After editing, your website can be automatically published via GitHub Pages at:
`https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

You can also use a custom domain if preferred.
