    We are the <strong>MIND Lab</strong>, based in the <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/mechanical-engineering/">Department of Mechanical Engineering</a> at 
    <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu">Binghamton University</a>. Our research integrates <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, 
    <strong>materials science</strong>, and <strong>computational chemistry</strong> to accelerate discovery of advanced materials for 
    <strong>energy innovations</strong>, <strong>next-generation technologies</strong>, and <strong>data-driven design</strong>.

<h2>The group focuses on:</h2>

<h3>Generative AI for atomic and molecular design</h3>
<p>
We apply generative models—including diffusion models—to explore and generate structures like amorphous carbon, nanoporous catalysts, and grain boundaries.
</p>

<h3>Data-driven spectroscopy interpretation</h3>
<p>
We use neural networks to connect experimental spectra (e.g., XANES) with structural features in disordered materials.
</p>

<h3>Structure–property learning</h3>
<p>
Our models identify how molecular structure and composition affect key performance indicators like catalytic activity, hydrogen storage capacity, or degradability.
</p>

<h3>Environmentally relevant materials</h3>
<p>
We predict degradation pathways, bioactivity, and defluorination potential for persistent chemicals like PFAS.
</p>

<h3>Application-driven insights</h3>
<p>
Our research supports design goals in clean energy, advanced coatings, separations, and catalysis by linking atomistic modeling with real-world targets.
