**AI for Materials Discovery**  
We use generative models and diffusion-based frameworks to explore atomic structures, grain boundaries, and amorphous materials.

**Data-Driven Spectroscopy**  
Combining DFT, XANES, and machine learning to interpret complex experimental spectra for disordered materials.

**Structure–Property Relationships**  
Learning how composition, defects, and synthesis conditions affect material performance across chemical and physical domains.
